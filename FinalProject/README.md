This is my final project for coding!
I'm most proud of how personal my site feels. I didn't want it to just be a portfolio—I wanted it to reflect the tone, emotion, and visual identity of my creative work. The writing page tells real stories I care about, the design section includes editorial pieces I built from scratch, and the photography page highlights how I see the world. Even small things like the quote from Ava Lavender and the muted color palette help shape a mood that feels like me.
In the future, I’d love to add more interactivity and polish. For example, I might create a lightbox gallery for photography, or add subtle animations to make transitions feel smoother. I’d also like to find a way to host and embed full stories (instead of just linking PDFs) so the writing feels more readable and integrated. As I build more projects, I see this site growing with me.
