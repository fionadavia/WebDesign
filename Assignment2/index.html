            <h3>Favorite Quotes from An Obsessed Reader</h3>
                <p> "Just because love don't look the way you think it should, don't mean you don't have it."
                <br>
                    "I found it ironic that I should be blessed with wings and yet feel so constrained, so trapped. It was because of my condition, I believe, that I noticed life's ironies a bit more often than the average person. I collected them: how love arrived when you least expected it, how someone who said he didn't want to hurt you eventually would."
                <br>
                    "Children betrayed their parents by becoming their own people."
                <br>
                    "To many, I was myth incarnate, the embodiment of a most superb legend, a fairy tale. Some considered me a monster, a mutation. To my great misfortune, I was once mistaken for an angel. To my mother, I was everything. To my father, nothing at all. To my grandmother, I was a daily reminder of loves long lost. But I knew the truth—deep down, I always did. <br>
                I was just a girl."
                <br>
                "By this point Viviane Lavender had loved Jack Griffith for twelve years, which was far more than half of her life. If she thought of her love as a commodity and were to, say, eat it, it would fill 4,745 cherry pies. If she were to preserve it, she would need 23,725 glass jars and labels and a basement spanning the length of Pinnacle Lane.
                <br>
                If she were to drink it, she'd drown."
                <br>
                "Fate. As a child, that word was often my only companion. It whispered to me from dark corners during lonely nights. It was the song of the birds in spring and the call of the wind through bare branches on a cold winter afternoon. Fate. Both my anguish and my solace. My escort and my cage."
                <br>
                "She spent her days trying to forget the sound of his voice, and her nights trying to remember."
                <br>
                "I loved you before, Ava. Let me love you still"
                <br>
                "Those born under Pacific Northwest skies are like daffodils: they can achieve beauty only after a long, cold sulk in the rain."
                <br>
                "I have traveled through continents, languages, and time trying to understand all that I am and all that has made me such."
                <br>
                "She is the glorious reincarnation of every woman ever loved."
                <br>
                "Falling out of love was much harder than Gabe would have liked. Normally led through life by the heart attached to his sleeve, finding logic in love proved to be a bit like getting vaccinated for some dread disease: a good idea in the end, but the initial pain certainly wasn’t any fun. He came to appreciate that there were worse ways to live than to live without love. For instance, if he didn’t have arms, Gabe wouldn’t be able to hide in his work. Yes, a life without arms would be quite tragic, indeed."

            <h3>My History With This Book</h3>
                <p> When I was in fifth grade my teacher, Mrs. Covington, gave books to each of the kids she taught when we "graduated". She gave me this book and told me to not read it until I was older. I obviously thought I knew better and read it immediately. She was right, shocker I know. I have read this book more times than I care to count. I have loved this book like everything else in my life, thoroughly, deeply and passionately. I brought it everywhere with me. It's seen every state and country I've been to. I believe that the things we have in this life deserve to be loved, because of this I strictly read hard-cover books because I also greatly enjoy admiring my books. On a teacher's salary of course I would not expect my lovely Mrs. Covington to gift all her children hard covers so I was given this as a paperback. That paperback looked loved in my opinion. It held my story along with its own. Water damage from my fish tank and the flood we experienced. A cracked spine from the years of reading. Yellowed pages bleached by its time being read in the sun. And the normal wear and tear of a 10-year-old book. I decided to get it rebound last year. I designed my own cover and sent my precious copy off to a lovely lady to revamp it. It now not only holds its history but has been provided with a sturdier foundation that will last it for the rest my life and the life of the next lucky reader to inherit it.</p>

                <h3>Why This Book Still Matters to Me</h3>
                <p>The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender was the book that made me fall in love with reading, not just in the way you enjoy a good story, but in the way something becomes a part of who you are. It's followed me through so many phases of life, and each time I return to it, I find something new that speaks to whatever version of myself I am currently finding. This book was the first story that felt bigger than a story, it felt like a reflection of how I see the world, or maybe how I want to see it: full of love, even when that love is painful or leaves you. I've always believed that a life full of love is a life well lived, and this book echoes that belief over and over again. It's about heartbreak, sure, but it's also about devotion, about choosing to love even when it hurts. Years later this story is still a home I return to. It's the reason I carry books with me everywhere. The reason I admire them like old friends. The reason I keep reading and loving things fiercely, even when it hurts.</p>
