# The Strange and Beautiful Sorrows of Ava Lavender
#### A (beautiful, heartbreaking, soul-wrenching) Novel by Leslye Walton

"Love makes us such fools." My 5th grade teacher gave me this book, she gave a book to each student that she felt fit them as a person. She gave me the book at our "graduation" and told me not to read it until I was older. I obviously ignored this advice (she was right) and read the most life-altering book at the ripe age of 10. I absolutely adore this book and will never shut up about it. You really should read it. 10/10
